**Unlocking Sales Growth: Leveraging RFM Analysis for LUURY Brand Enhancement in Q4'21-Q1'22**



Welcome to the repository for my final project during my data science program at RevoU! In this project, 
I tackled the real-world business challenge of declining sales for a luxury brand over the period of Q4'21 to Q1'22.


**Key Features:**

RFM Analysis: Leveraged the power of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value analysis to delve into customer behavior and segmentation.

Root Cause Analysis & EDA: Explored and identified potential reasons behind the sales decline through rigorous Root Cause Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis.

Kaggle Dataset: Utilized the Shopping Cart Database from Kaggle, offering a rich set of data to extract meaningful insights.



**Project Highlights:**

Top 5 Performance: Achieved recognition as one of the top 5 students, showcasing the depth and quality of the project.

Judge's Insights: Incorporated valuable advice and recommendations from expert judges during Pitching Week to enhance the final project.

Collaborative Effort: Special thanks to Kak Lexa, Kak Fakhri, and Kak Ulfa for their pivotal roles in guiding and supporting me throughout the project.
